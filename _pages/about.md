Hi! I am currently a research assistant in the [Natural Language Processing Lab (THUNLP)](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/) at Tsinghua University, advised by [Professor Zhiyuan Liu](https://nlp.csai.tsinghua.edu.cn/~lzy/) during my gap year. My research interests focus on long-context modeling for large language models (LLMs) and their applications in recommender systems. Prior to this, I earned my bachelor's degree from China University of Geosciences, Beijing.

News
======
● 2024-11: One paper is accepted to TOIS on applying LLMs for Generative Recommendation! 

● 2024-07: One paper is accepted to RecSys 2024 (Oral) on evaluating LLM's function in sequence modeling for Sequential Recommendation!
